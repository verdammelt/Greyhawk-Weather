This program will assist in the generation of randomized weather for
the Greyhawk AD&D Campaign setting.  It uses data from the Greyhawk
Boxed set (circa 1983) for AD&D 1e.

The todo.org file lists the "stories" for this project in prioritzed
order. If a story is marked DONE then it is in theory working.

Thanks
Mark
