* Release #1
Minimum features needed to let me use the tool in my own game
** DONE determine base temp given the month
** DONE calc date's temp range given date
** DONE Need a good way to store/define the baseline data - hardcoded in the baselinedata file is ugly!
** DONE add a readme file to make github happy.
** DONE get weather for multiple days
** DONE remove current 'day' parameter
** DONE add numdays parameter
** DONE get weather from beginning of month for that many days
** DONE handle getting number of days overlapping with another month
** DONE need to calc current weather condition (sunny/partly-cloudy/cloudy)
** DONE determine if there is precip for a date
** DONE add to baseline and add acceptance test.
** DONE determine if there is record high/low
** DONE wind speed / direction
** DONE determine what sort of precip it is
*** DONE just baseline data of precip
*** DONE refactor to have array of precip
*** DONE refactor to have null precip
*** DONE new Precipitation class seprate from PrecipitationInfo.  New class embodies the actual precipitation
*** DONE determine continuing precip
*** DONE determine rainbow
** DONE standardize output like my sheets
** check for requirements on precip
*** TODO temp range
*** TODO terrain
** need to calc diff in base temp caused by latitude
** duration of record high/low

** determine windspeed from precipitation

* need to calc diff in sun-rise/-set time caused by longitude
* need to calc diff in base temp caused by altitude
* phase of moons for date
* sunrise/sunset times for date
* modify weather given terrain
* interpret special precipitation (based upon terrain)
* report wind chill temp
* report high wind effect table
* report affects of precip (duration etc.)
* humidity
* arbitrary start day
* greyhawk calendar festivals
* DONE rearrange code a bit (helper classes in subdirectories etc.)
* precipitation occurance chart should not be publically a ranged hash?
* ranged hash sorting is bad stuff (and not yet complete!)
