* DONE determine base temp given the month
* DONE calc date's temp range given date
* DONE Need a good way to store/define the baseline data - hardcoded in the baselinedata file is ugly!
* DONE add a readme file to make github happy.
* DONE get weather for multiple days
** DONE remove current 'day' parameter
** DONE add numdays parameter
** DONE get weather from beginning of month for that many days
* DONE handle getting number of days overlapping with another month
* DONE need to calc current weather condition (sunny/partly-cloudy/cloudy)
* DONE determine if there is precip for a date
** DONE add to baseline and add acceptance test.
* TODO determine what sort of precip it is
** DONE just baseline data of precip
** TODO special precip too
** TODO report effects of precip
** TODO determine continuing precip
* determine if there is record high/low
* need to calc diff in base temp caused by latitude
* need to calc diff in sun-rise/-set time caused by longitude
* need to calc diff in base temp caused by altitude
* phase of moons for date
* sunrise/sunset times for date
* modify weather given terrain
* report wind chill temp
* wind speed / direction
* report high wind effect table
* check for requirements on precip
* report affects of precip
* humidity
* arbitrary start day
* greyhawk calendar festivals
* rearrange code a bit (helper classes in subdirectories etc.)
